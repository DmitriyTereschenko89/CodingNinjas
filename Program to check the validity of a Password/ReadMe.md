# Program to check the validity of a Password

Problem statement
Ninjas are trying to hack a system of a terrorist organization so that they can know where they will be going to attack next. But to hack the system and to get access to data they need a password that must satisfy certain conditions as described below:

1) Length of the password must be between 8 to 15 characters.
2) At least one digit (0-9), one lowercase letter (a-z), one uppercase letter (A-Z) and one special character (%, ^, &, #, *, %, etc) must be present.
3) Password must not contain any space.
You are given a string ‘STR’, help ninjas to find whether it's a valid password or not.

For example :

Given ‘STR’ =  “Codingninja#1” As it satisfies all the above conditions so it is a valid password and therefore you have to return true.

## Sample Input 1:
3
CODiNGNinja+1
abcXyz 123
itsnotValid1
## Sample Output 1:
Valid
Not Valid
Not Valid
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Test Case 1 :  
Given ‘STR’ = CODiNGNinja+1
As we can see that this string satisfies all the given conditions in the problem.
Therefore, it's a valid password.

Test Case 2 : 
Given ‘STR’ = abcXyz 123 
As the given string contains a space, so it's not a valid password.

Test Case 3:
Given ‘STR’ =  itsnotValid1
As the string does not contain any special character, so it’s not a valid password.
## Sample Input 2:
